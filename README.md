# gomelli
gomelli is a tool aimed at managing rapid, short-term project assignment.

The title of the project is a reference to [Gemelli][], a variety of pasta. Gemelli is a single piece of pasta that appears to be two pieces twisted together.

gomelli is targetted toward small development shops who may be currently sharing files and deploying via [Dropbox][], [Google Drive][], or some other file-sharing service. They may be using these services to sync a folder of project files, or to deliver files for deployment. Often environments that force proprietary GUI-based tooling foster this kind of colaboration. Two examples: [AMX][] and [Crestron][].

The developers on these platforms don't tend to have a workflow that involves working in a shell â€“ indeed, many of these developers aren't comfortable working in a Windows Command Prompt. Asking developers to `cd` to their project directory, `git add -A *`, `git commit -m 'fix projector power time'`, `git push` for every compile/load/test/deploy cycle is a non-starter for many of them.

gomelli aims to work differently than that. It delivers a smaller set of functions, laser-focused on the needs of these kinds of companies.

## Collaboration
In a small shop with two or more developers, a single developer will take a project for a short period of time, possibly through the initial phase of deployment. In an ideal world, this developer will take the project through testing and troubleshooting until project sign off. But this often isn't the case when resource availability and schedules change.
