# gomelli
gomelli is a tool aimed at managing rapid, short-term project assignment.

The title of the project is a reference to [Gemelli][], a variety of pasta. Gemelli is a single piece of pasta that appears to be two pieces twisted together.

gomelli is targetted toward small development shops who may be currently sharing files and deploying via [Dropbox][], [Google Drive][], or some other file-sharing service. They may be using these services to sync a folder of project files, or to deliver files for deployment. Often environments that force proprietary GUI-based tooling foster this kind of colaboration. Two examples: [AMX][] and [Crestron][].

The developers on these platforms don't tend to have a workflow that involves working in a shell â€“ indeed, many of these developers aren't comfortable working in a Windows Command Prompt.
